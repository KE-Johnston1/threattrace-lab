# ThreatTrace Lab Summary

ThreatTrace Lab is a modular cybersecurity project designed to simulate real-world threat scenarios and demonstrate SOC workflows. It is structured around three core layers:

1. **Offensive Simulation**  
   Ethical emulation of attacker behaviour to generate realistic honeypot logs.

2. **Defensive Detection**  
   Parsing and visualising honeypot data to identify suspicious activity, including anomaly detection and signature matching.

3. **Analyst Investigation**  
   Timeline construction, IOC extraction, and incident reporting based on parsed data and visual outputs.

Each module is standalone and beginner-friendly, with clear documentation and ethical framing. The lab is intended for portfolio development, recruiter engagement, and practical learning.

Current focus: SSH brute force detection using honeypot logs, heatmap visualisation, and case study documentation.
