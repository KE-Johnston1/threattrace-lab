# Honeypot Heatmap Visualizer

This module parses honeypot logs and generates a visual heatmap of attacker interactions over time.  
It supports anomaly detection, IP clustering, and behavioral pattern mapping.

## Goals
- Visualize attacker behavior across time and ports
- Highlight repeat offenders and tool signatures
- Integrate with existing honeypot CLI output

## Status
 In development â€” initial parser and mock data setup underway.
