# ThreatTrace Lab

Modular SOC simulation lab exploring attacker behaviour through offensive emulation, defensive detection, and analyst investigation.

## Overview

ThreatTrace Lab breaks down real-world threats into three layers:

- Offensive Simulation: Ethical emulation of attacker tactics using custom scripts and tooling  
- Defensive Detection: Honeypot logs, parsers, heatmaps, anomaly detection, and signature matching  
- Analyst Investigation: Timeline building, IOC extraction, and case study documentation

Each module is standalone, beginner-friendly, and designed for clarity, ethical framing, and recruiter impact.

## Modules

| Layer       | Folder                      | Description                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Offensive   | `offensive-simulation`      | Simulated brute force attacks (coming soon)      |
| Defensive   | [`heatmap-visualiser`](heatmap-visualizer/README.md) | Honeypot logs, heatmaps, anomaly detection       |
| Analyst     | `analyst-investigation`     | Timeline builder, IOC extraction (coming soon)   |
| Shared      | `shared-assets`             | Sample logs, diagrams, screenshots               |

## Featured Module: Heatmap Visualiser

- Parses honeypot logs and generates time-vs-port heatmaps  
- Flags anomalous IPs with high activity  
- Matches attacker patterns (e.g. Nmap, brute force)  
- Includes CLI wrapper, sample output gallery, and a full case study

View the case study: [`case-study.md`](heatmap-visualizer/case-study.md)

## Goals

- Showcase practical SOC workflows  
- Demonstrate ethical awareness and adaptability  
- Empower others through clear, modular documentation

## Status

- Heatmap Visualiser module complete  
- Offensive and Analyst modules in development  
- More case studies and visualisations coming soon
