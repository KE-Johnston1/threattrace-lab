# ThreatTrace Lab

**Modular SOC simulation lab exploring attacker behavior through offensive emulation, defensive detection, and analyst investigation.**

---

##  Overview

ThreatTrace Lab breaks down real-world threats into three layers:

- **Offensive Simulation**: Ethical emulation of attacker tactics using custom scripts and tooling
- **Defensive Detection**: Honeypot logs, parsers, heatmaps, anomaly detection, and signature matching
- **Analyst Investigation**: Timeline building, IOC extraction, and case study documentation

Each module is standalone, beginner-friendly, and designed for clarity, ethical framing, and recruiter impact.

##  Featured Module: Heatmap Visualizer

- Parses honeypot logs and generates time-vs-port heatmaps
- Flags anomalous IPs with high activity
- Matches attacker patterns (e.g. Nmap, brute force)
- Includes CLI wrapper, sample output gallery, and a full case study

##  Goals

- Showcase practical SOC workflows
- Demonstrate ethical awareness and trainability
- Empower others through clear, modular documentation

---

##  Status

- âœ… Heatmap Visualizer module complete
- ðŸ”„ Offensive and Analyst modules in development
