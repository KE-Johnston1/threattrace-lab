# ThreatTrace Lab

**Modular SOC lab exploring one threat through offensive simulation, defensive detection, and analyst investigation.**

---

## Project Overview

This lab breaks down a single threat—starting with SSH brute force—into three perspectives:

- **Offensive Simulation**: Emulate attacker behavior using custom scripts and tools.
- **Defensive Detection**: Parse logs, trigger alerts, and visualize suspicious activity.
- **Analyst Investigation**: Build timelines, extract IOCs, and document findings.

Each module is standalone and beginner-friendly, with step-by-step walkthroughs and ethical framing.

|-------|--------|-------------|
| Offensive | `offensive-simulation` | Simulated brute force attacks |
| Defensive | `defensive-detection` | Honeypot logs, parsers, alerting |
| Analyst | `analyst-investigation` | Timeline builder, IOC extraction |
| Shared | `shared-assets` | Sample logs, diagrams, screenshots |
